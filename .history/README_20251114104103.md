# SD WebUI Mobile Friendly

<h4 align="right"><i>BETA</i></h4>

This is an extension for the [AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)  
designed to improve usability when viewing the interface in **portrait** mode.  
It rearranges several UI elements to make navigation smoother on mobile devices.

## Installation

Navigate to the `extensions` folder inside your Stable Diffusion WebUI installation directory,  
then run the following command to clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/end888160/sd-webui-mobile-friendly.git
```

Or download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it into the `extensions` folder.

After cloning, restart the WebUI to activate the extension.

## Known Incompatibilities

- **[sd-webui-prompt-all-in-one](https://github.com/Physton/sd-webui-prompt-all-in-one)**  
  The prompt template box overlaps with the generation result panel, causing layout issues on mobile.  
  (No fix yet — requires a dedicated compatibility patch.)

## Features

1. Automatically switches between portrait and landscape layouts based on viewport aspect ratio.
2. Moves the generation result panel to the top of the page for quicker access.
3. Adds a **“Scroll to Top”** button at the bottom of the interface.
4. Slightly enlarges certain buttons  
   - Specifically those using the `tool` class.
5. Increases padding between sliders for easier touch interaction.
6. Centers action buttons inside each `form`.
7. Keeps the **Generate / Interrupt / Skip** button fixed at the bottom of the viewport for quick access.
